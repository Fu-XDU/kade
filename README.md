# Kade

A P2P client which implements the Kademlia protocol. 

### Notes

If your node does not have a static IP address, other nodes cannot reach you due to the NAT.

I tried geth, it also has this problem. 

Maybe NAT traversal is a solution, but it does not 100% work.

So, make sure each of your nodes has its own static IP address.
