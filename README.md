# Kade

A simple P2P client which implements the Kademlia protocol. 

### Notes

In Kade, if your node does not have a static IP address, other nodes cannot reach you due to the NAT.

I tried geth, two peers behind each NAT can be connected successfully.

Make sure each of your nodes has its own static IP address.
